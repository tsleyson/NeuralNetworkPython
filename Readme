A neural network in Python for the male/female recognition problem. My plan is to
use an adjacency matrix to represent the graph of the network and weights, Numpy for 
handling the matrices, and the multiprocessing module for concurrency. My hope is that
this will be enough to overcome that dismal 50% error rate from the Java version.
